Informatics Github Assignment #1
Hi, I'm Jacob, I'm 20 and working towards a Computer Science degree, so programming is a big interest of mine. I tend to struggle with working up the courage to speak on discussion threads, however, since I never feel confident enough about a topic to discuss or criticize others, so I apologize for that. I like video games, music, chess, programming, history and philosophy. I have an old cat named WALL-E, yes like the robot, I was a kid when I named him.
